# Rules of the game:

The player will guess a letter. If that letter is
in the word then the system will add the letter in everywhere it would appear. If
the letter isn't in the word then a body part will be added to the gallows and 
the letter will appear in wrong guesses (horisontal gallow, verticle gallow, head,
body, left arm, right arm, left leg, right leg). The player will
continue guessing letters until they can either solve the word
or all six body parts are on the gallows.

## To win the game:

The executioner wins if the full body is hanging from the gallows. The
guesser wins if they guess the word before the person is hung.
